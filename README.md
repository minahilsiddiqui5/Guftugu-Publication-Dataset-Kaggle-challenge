About Dataset
Context
This is the one of its kinds book sales dataset from Pakistan. It contains 20,000 book orders from January 2019 to January 2021. The data was collected from the merchant (Gufhtugu Publications www.Gufhtugu.com) who are partner in this research study.
There is a dire need for such dataset to learn about Pakistanâ€™s emerging e-commerce potential and I hope this will help many startups in many ways.
